## WHY I BUILT THIS

I wanted to build a simple yet fully CRUD app to translate my knowledge to more complex future projects. 

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _USESTATE_

- Adding a new task to LocalStorage with a unique ID along with text entered by the user
- Removing the task with passed id from LocalStorage
- Marking the selected task as the one being edited and populating the input field with its specific text

### _USEEFFECT_

- Saving tasks to LocalStorage when the tasks change.

### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc
- Using CSS Position, Grid and Flexbox

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, images, etc

## MOST CHALLENGING
